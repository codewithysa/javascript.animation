        that the Chinese supreme deity Jade Emperor held a birthday party and would decide the order of 
        the zodiac animals according to their arrival times. Originally, the hardworking Ox departed early 
        and should be the first one to reach. However, the Rat hid in the Oxâ€™s ear and jumped down when arriving,
         occupying the first place. Thus the Rat had since been the No. 1 in the 12-year cycle and represents spirit, 
         wit, alertness, delicacy, and flexibility.</p>
