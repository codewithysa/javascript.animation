         Year Of The Rat
        <br/>An interesting Chinese legend about the ranking of the Rat goes 
        that the Chinese supreme deity Jade Emperor held a birthday party and would decide the order of 
        the zodiac animals according to their arrival times. Originally, the hardworking Ox departed early 
        and should be the first one to reach. However, the Rat hid in the Ox’s ear and jumped down when arriving,
         occupying the first place. Thus the Rat had since been the No. 1 in the 12-year cycle and represents spirit, 
         wit, alertness, delicacy, and flexibility.</p>

       Year of The Ox’s
       <br/>Oxen used to be capable farming tools in an agricultural society, which attach to the symbol of diligence, persistence,
        and honesty. In Chinese culture, Ox is a faithful friend that made great contributions to the development of the society.
        Like the ox, people born in the Year of the Ox are industrious, cautious, hold their faith firmly, and always glad to offer help.
